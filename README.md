# Meteor Boilerplate ES6

This is an empty boilerplate of the official [Meteor Todos app](https://github.com/meteor/todos). Use this repo as a clear reference on how to create templates, collections, testing, etc. [My fork](https://github.com/AlexHenkel/todos) has the version at the time this boilerplate was created.

### Running the app

```bash
meteor npm install
meteor
```

### Scripts

To lint:

```bash
meteor npm run lint
```
### Continuous integration

This boilerplate comes with CircleCI configuration
To show CI badge, after the project was successfully configured at [Circle CL](https://cicleci.com), this is the code to get the badge:
